Klone Killer
-------------

I faced a problem when I had too many duplicate files in a folder. I want
to delete the duplicates, and it took lot of effort to find the duplicates.
So I wrote this program to get all files in a directory, find its
duplicates and list them.

Just putting this code so that it might be useful for some one who faces
the same problem as I do.

Where it works
---------------

Klone Killer was tested on Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit with Python 2.7.5+ . It
should work well on all Ubuntu / Debian systems at present that has
Python 2.7.3.

How to use it
---------------

* Download it
* Goto the directory where it is
* Type the following in terminal
 
```
$ python klone_killer.py
```
