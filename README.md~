Klone Killer
-------------

I faced a problem when I had too many duplicate files in a folder. I want
to delete the duplicates, and it took lot of effort to find the duplicates.
So I wrote this program to get all files in a directory, find its
duplicates and list them.

Just putting this code so that it might be useful for some one who faces
the same problem as I do.

Where it works
---------------

Klone Killer was tested on Ubuntu 12.0 64-bit, Python 2.7.3 . It should work well
on all Ubuntu systems at present that has Python 2.7.3 and other Debian and its derivatives too.
